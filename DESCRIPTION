Title: Interpolation From C
Version: 1.0.1
Description: Simple interpolation methods designed to be used from C
    code. Supports constant, linear and spline interpolation. An R
    wrapper is included but this package is primarily designed to be
    used from C code using 'LinkingTo'.  The spline calculations are
